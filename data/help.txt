Help:
The interface tries to be concice and lead you through
using it.
Most commands are represented by a single letter,
    advanced users can note that more letters can be entered at a time 
    resulting in many actions, say that I want to get into the sales menu
    and start a order for a costumer John Johnsen with the phonenumber 1234567
    That can be achived through our shorthand of writing "sc John Johnsen 1234567"
After a command is entered the <return> key should be pressed.

For an example and a walk through of using the interface see : <youtubelink>
